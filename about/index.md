I'm currently a fellow in the [Data Science for Social Good program](http://dssg.io) at the [University of Chicago](http://uchicago.edu).
I'm working predicting the effects of municipal investments on propoerty values.

I hold a BA in [Geography](http://geog.ucsb.edu) from the [University of California, Santa Barbara](http://www.ucsb.edu). My interests lie in transportation, and public transport in particular. I am especially interested in computational modeling and analysis of transportation networks.

I am a developer on the [OpenTripPlanner project](http://www.opentripplanner.org), a tool for trip planning and transit network analysis; I've used it in [several](/2013/06/20/microaccessibility-with-opentripplanner/) [research](/cgs2012/) [projects](http://www.indicatrix.org/2014/05/01/predicting-the-popularity-of-bicycle-sharing-stations/). This open-source tool allows calculation of accessibility measures, which can be used to evaluate land-use and transportation network changes.

I also have on-the-ground experience with public transportation operations; I worked in the Service Planning department of [San Francisco Muni](http://www.sfmta.com) during the summer of 2013. At Muni, I worked on diverse projects including intersection reconfiguration for transit efficiency and traffic signal design for a Bus Rapid Transit line.

I can be reached by email at [matt@indicatrix.org](mailto:matt@indicatrix.org).

I've lived and worked in a number of cities, which are displayed below.
