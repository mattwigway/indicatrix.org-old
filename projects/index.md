Here are a few of the projects I am involved in:

* [Transit Appliance Project](http://transitappliance.org)<br/>
The transit appliance project aims to put real time transit
information everywhere. We provide a lightweight JavaScript API that
can be used by app developers as well as several apps. The primary
goal of our platform is to build zero-configuration machines: plug it
in, turn it on, and see transit arrivals (you have to configure what
stops you want, of course, via a web interface, but there should be no
on-site configuration).

* [OpenTripPlanner](http://opentripplanner.org) and OpenTripPlanner
  Analyst.<br/>
 OpenTripPlanner is a project to create an open-source multimodal
  transit, pedestrian and bicycle trip planner. Out of the box, it can
  be used to plan trips combining multiple transit systems, walking and
  cycling. OpenTripPlanner Analyst is a companion program, using the
same codebase, that can be used for calculating urban mobility and
effects of service changes. I have worked on various features,
including elevator support, graph debugging tools, and web app
usability. If you&#8217;d like to get started, check out Frank
Purcell&#8217;s
[excellent introduction](https://github.com/openplans/OpenTripPlanner/wiki/TwoMinutes).

* I&#8217;ve written quite a few small transit and GIS related tools,
including a tool to put geotagged tweets into PostGIS, a tool to
archive NextBus data, and a tool to synchronize an SQL database with a
transit agency using GTFS-realtime. These and many other projects are
available at [my GitHub](http://github.com/mattwigway).
