These two animated maps show the accessibility to eateries at
different times of the day and the week, at the University of
California, Santa Barbara and in the adjacent student community of
Isla Vista. The accessibilities are calculated using a simple
cumulative-opportunities measure for opportunities within 5
minutes. Created with
