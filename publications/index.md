My publications and presentations, listed in reverse-chronological
order. Also available in [BibTeX](/publications/matt_conway.bib) or
[RIS](/publications/matt_conway.ris) format. Click on the citation of
a paper to see the abstract.

I don't really like reading other people's slides, but some people do so I include slides here. As always, if you have questions or comments about anything please [contact me](/contact)!

    <div id="Conway201405abs" class="collapse abstract">Bikesharing systems have been growing quickly of late. They
consist of stations distributed throughout a city where one can check out a
bike for short trips. Some stations are more popular than others. This
project develops statistical models to predict station popularity based on the
accessibility of stations to jobs and housing. Linear regression and random
forest regression are employed. The models are then transferred to other
systems to evaluate their efficacy as planning tools for new systems.
Models do not predict as well as might have been hoped, nor is there any
one model that performs uniformly well in all cities. Spatial autocorrelation
is present both in the popularities and the residuals from most of the
models, indicating that spatial effects (such as accessibility) have not been
fully explained.</div>

    <div id="Conway201304abs" class="collapse abstract">Jane
    Jacobs, the noted author of <i>The Death and Life of Great
    American Cities</i>, advanced many ideas that can be seen as
    iconoclastic. However, these ideas are in many cases very similar
    to the ideas of another important vein of scholarship, the the
    global cities hypothesis, which examines the role of cities in
    globalization. Jacobs's ideas and the ideas of the global cities
    scholars are largely constructed independently. This article
    examines the connections between the two. It works systematically,
    starting with small-scale phenomena and progressing to comments on
    global-scale phenomena.</div>

    <div id="Conway2013abs" class="collapse abstract">This
    article argues that some of the university class can be
    productively moved online, while some cannot. In particular, it
    argues that lectures work very well online, but expresses concern
    that other parts of the university experience do not. It argues
    that unstructured time between students and professors is critical
    to creating a community of scholars, but that this can easily be
    lost in the online environment. It also gives suggestions about
    how to structure and present online lecture material.  <br/>

Urban Mobility and Accessibility Using OpenTripPlanner Analyst.”
Poster presented at the annual meeting of the California Geographical
Society, Davis, California, April 27–29, 2012.</a> <a

<div id="Conway201204abs" class="collapse abstract">Measures of urban mobility and accessibility are
useful in many situations, from real estate to urban planning. Some
methods of measuring and visualizing mobility and accessibility
include making travel-time isochrones, measuring travel time effects
of network changes, measuring accessibility using opportunity data,
and creating time-space prisms. Transit, walking and cycling are more
important to mobility than driving in many urban areas. This poster
examines how the open-source OpenTripPlanner Analyst software can be
used in conjunction with open transit agency and street network data
to create visualizations of multimodal mobility, accessibility and
changes in travel time.</div> </li>
