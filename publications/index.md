  <p>
  Measures of urban mobility and accessibility are useful in many
  situations, from real estate to urban planning. Some methods of
  measuring and visualizing mobility and accessibility include making
  travel-time isochrones, measuring travel time effects of network
  changes, measuring accessibility using opportunity data, and
  creating time-space prisms. Transit, walking and cycling are more
  important to mobility than driving in many urban areas. This poster
  examines how the open-source OpenTripPlanner Analyst software can be
  used in conjunction with open transit agency and street network data
  to create visualizations of multimodal mobility, accessibility and
  changes in travel time.

    article argues that some of the university class can be
    productively moved online, while some cannot. In particular, it
    argues that lectures work very well online, but expresses concern
    that other parts of the university experience do not. It argues
    that unstructured time between students and professors is critical
    to creating a community of scholars, but that this can easily be
    lost in the online environment. It also gives suggestions about
    how to structure and present online lecture material.
