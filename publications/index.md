  <p>
  Measures of urban mobility and accessibility are useful in many
  situations, from real estate to urban planning. Some methods of
  measuring and visualizing mobility and accessibility include making
  travel-time isochrones, measuring travel time effects of network
  changes, measuring accessibility using opportunity data, and
  creating time-space prisms. Transit, walking and cycling are more
  important to mobility than driving in many urban areas. This poster
  examines how the open-source OpenTripPlanner Analyst software can be
  used in conjunction with open transit agency and street network data
  to create visualizations of multimodal mobility, accessibility and
  changes in travel time.
