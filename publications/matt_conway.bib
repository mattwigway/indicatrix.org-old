abstract = {Measures of urban mobility and accessibility are useful in many situations, from real estate to urban planning. Some methods of measuring and visualizing mobility and accessibility include making travel-time isochrones, measuring travel time effects of network changes, measuring accessibility using opportunity data, and creating time-space prisms. Transit, walking and cycling are more important to mobility than driving in many urban areas. This poster examines how the open-source OpenTripPlanner Analyst software can be used in conjunction with open transit agency and street network data to create visualizations of multimodal mobility, accessibility and changes in travel time.},
