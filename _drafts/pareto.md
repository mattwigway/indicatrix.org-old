title: Pareto Surfaces and Urban Planning (or, why planning is hard)

Urban planning is the process through which we as a society decide how to guide future development of our
cities. As anyone who's been involved in a planning process can tell you, it is a very difficult field. I
argue that the reason for this is because there are no easy wins in plannng; we cannot improve outcomes in one
dimension without making them worse in another.

The theoretical underpinnings of what I'm describing is known as [Pareto efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency).
The gist is that you have multiple measures which you would like to maximize. A scenario is Pareto-efficient when you cannot
improve any measure of interest without making  Let's take an example from public transport;
suppose your city wishes to create the highest ridership public transit system possible, while serving as many of
the residents of the region as possible. I've lifted [this example](http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au//bitstream/2123/6057/1/thredbo10-themeA-Walker.pdf)
from Jarrett Walker of [Human Transit](http://humantransit.org). Walker has presented these two goals as being in
opposition, which they are. Another way to think of two opposing goals is as defining a Pareto surface. Suppose that one
of your goals is to have the highest possible ridership on your transit system, and another is to have
bus service available to as many residents of the region as possible. We can plot this as a Pareto curve:

Three scenarios are shown: the blue dot represents a higher-ridership but lower-coverage scenario,
while the brown scenario has higher coverage but lower ridership. The black line represents the Pareto
surface: there are many possible scenarios that lie on the line, all of which are Pareto-efficient.
You cannot improve one outcome without making the other worse for any scenario on this line. Thus,
the points on the line represent different possible tradeoffs that could be made between providing
high-ridership service and providing coverage to as many residents as possible. The orange scenario
is not Pareto-efficient: there are scenarios that have both higher ridership _and_ higher coverage.
Of course the notion of Pareto efficiency can be extended to more than two dimensions; suppose we added
a third dimension to the plot above, say 

Here is the crux of the problem with planning, and the key unproven assertion of this post. I posit
that the current urban system is Pareto-efficient when one considers all of the dimensions that someone
cares about---everything from reducing greenhouse gas emissions to decreasing congested lane-miles to
reducing tax burden. One must also include personal dimensions in the Pareto-space we consider: for example,
I may care that a new plan doesn't require taking my home by eminent domain for new infrastructure or development,
or I may care that a plan not reduce demand for a product that I sell, such as oil or cars. Regardless of whether
how any one person feels about any of these dimensions of planning, someone who has some political power
cares about all of them.

We cannot improve outcomes on any
dimension without making them worse on another dimension that someone cares about. This is why planning is not
an exact science, and why there is a need for public participation in planning. Strict technocracy, in which we
move towards an ideal or optimal outcome, does not exist. There are infinitely many solutions Pareto-efficient plans
for a city, of which the current plan is one. Planning is the process of choosing between these plans, which means that
planning is a process of choosing which dimensions we value more. Since some people value certain dimensions more than
others, this means that planning is the process of choosing winners and losers, hopefully in an open and democratic
manner. There is no such thing as an objective improvement in any currently-existing urban system, and trying to
plan as if we can make things objectively better is counterproductive. So, be prepared for hard conversations if you want to be a planner!
