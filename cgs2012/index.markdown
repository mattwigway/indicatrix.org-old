I presented a poster on [OpenTripPlanner Analyst](http://github.com/openplans/opentripplanner-analyst) at the [California Geographical Society](http://calgeog.org) 2012 conference. Here are the poster and some companion materials:
	
  * [Poster (PDF, 1.7MB)](/a/cgs2012/urbanmobilityposter.pdf)---the poster itself.

	
  * [Maps (PDF, 7.8MB)](/a/cgs2012/urbanmobilitymapbook.pdf)---all of the maps that were present on the poster. Some were somewhat small, here is a PDF of all of them in vector format, suitable for stretching across the sides of large buildings.

	
  * [Methodology (PDF, 207KB)](/a/cgs2012/urbanmobilitymethodology.pdf)---the methodology behind making each of the figures. This is a more in-depth, technical explanation than was provided on the poster itself.
