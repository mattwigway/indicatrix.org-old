  <h2>Conditional Labels in QGIS</h2>
</a>
<p class="author">by mattwigway on March 03, 2012</p>

<p>I fairly commonly find myself in a situation where I would like to display one label for certain features and another for other features in the same layer. QGIS doesn&rsquo;t have an official way to split labels up into categories, and until now I&rsquo;d resorted to having two layers to render otherwise identical features. But, in the new, excellent <a href="http://woostuff.wordpress.com/2011/10/27/expression-based-labeling/">expression based labeling</a> from Nathan Woodrow, I realized one can use an SQL CASE statement. For instance, one time I need to use two types labels is when labeling roads in OpenStreetMap: I want to use the name tag, <em>unless</em> the feature has a ref tag defined (a name tag might be &lsquo;Capital City Freeway&rsquo;, while the ref tag would be &lsquo;US 50&rsquo;). Here&rsquo;s how I solved that particular problem:</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="sql"><span class="k">CASE</span>
    <span class="k">WHEN</span> <span class="k">ref</span> <span class="k">IS</span> <span class="k">NOT</span> <span class="k">NULL</span> <span class="k">THEN</span> <span class="k">ref</span>
    <span class="k">ELSE</span> <span class="n">name</span>
<span class="k">END</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>For now, anyhow, you&rsquo;ll need to be running the dev build of QGIS. Happy GISing!</p>

  <h2>More Basemaps in QGIS</h2>
</a>
<p class="author">by mattwigway on February 02, 2012</p>

<p>One of the more popular posts on this blog has been my piece on <a href="/2011/04/06/basemaps-in-qgis/">adding basemaps to QGIS</a>. While the OpenLayer plugin is great, one of the things that I find dissatisfying is that it requires reprojecting your data to match the EPSG:3857 basemap. I often work in State Plane, and I&rsquo;d just as soon have my data stay in that projection, which will also minimize local distortion. Well, as it turns out, one can add tiled map services as GDAL raster layers, with all the benefits that entails (e.g. reprojection). What you need to do is create an XML file like the following (which is lifted almost verbatim from <a href="http://www.gdal.org/frmt_wms.html">the GDAL website</a>, specifically <a href="http://www.gdal.org/frmt_wms_openstreetmap_tms.xml">this file</a>):</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="xml"><span class="nt">&lt;GDAL_WMS&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;Service</span> <span class="na">name=</span><span class="s">&quot;TMS&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
    <span class="c">&lt;!-- note: if you use this file verbatim, you *must* credit MapQuest and OpenStreetMap! --&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;ServerUrl&gt;</span>http://otile1.mqcdn.com/tiles/1.0.0/osm/${z}/${x}/${y}.png<span class="nt">&lt;/ServerUrl&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/Service&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;DataWindow&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;UpperLeftX&gt;</span>-20037508.34<span class="nt">&lt;/UpperLeftX&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;UpperLeftY&gt;</span>20037508.34<span class="nt">&lt;/UpperLeftY&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;LowerRightX&gt;</span>20037508.34<span class="nt">&lt;/LowerRightX&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;LowerRightY&gt;</span>-20037508.34<span class="nt">&lt;/LowerRightY&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;TileLevel&gt;</span>18<span class="nt">&lt;/TileLevel&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;TileCountX&gt;</span>1<span class="nt">&lt;/TileCountX&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;TileCountY&gt;</span>1<span class="nt">&lt;/TileCountY&gt;</span>
    <span class="nt">&lt;YOrigin&gt;</span>top<span class="nt">&lt;/YOrigin&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;/DataWindow&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;Projection&gt;</span>EPSG:3857<span class="nt">&lt;/Projection&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;BlockSizeX&gt;</span>256<span class="nt">&lt;/BlockSizeX&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;BlockSizeY&gt;</span>256<span class="nt">&lt;/BlockSizeY&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;BandsCount&gt;</span>3<span class="nt">&lt;/BandsCount&gt;</span>
  <span class="nt">&lt;Cache/&gt;</span>
<span class="nt">&lt;/GDAL_WMS&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
</div>


<p>Change the ServerUrl to your Tiled Map Service server (this one is for MapQuest Open Tiles), then go into QGIS, Layer-&gt;Add Raster Layer and select the XML file.</p>

<p>A few caveats:</p>

<ul>
<li>The OpenLayers plugin automatically adds the required attributions, at least for OSM. This can be nice or not—nice in that you don&rsquo;t have to remember to add the attribution, not so nice in that you can&rsquo;t choose where to place the attribution; it&rsquo;s always in the lower-right.</li>
<li>Reprojecting layers with text may yield strange skewing and distortion.</li>
<li>You need to be sure that you use these services legally (as you did with OpenLayers plugin).</li>
</ul>


<p>Have fun!</p>

<p>You can also convert tiles to GeoTIFF using gdal_translate, but I suspect most TMS providers would prefer you didn&rsquo;t.</p>

  <h2>Transit to Everywhere</h2>
</a>
<p class="author">by mattwigway on December 30, 2011</p>

<p><a href="/a/2011-12-30-transit-to-everywhere/toeverywheresftransit10.png"><img src="/a/2011-12-30-transit-to-everywhere/toeverywheresftransit10.png" alt="" /></a>
<em>Data courtesy MapQuest and OpenStreetMap CC-BY-SA, the City and County of San Francisco, and Bay Area Rapid Transit</em></p>

<p>This is an overlay of the transit and walking trip plans generated by OpenTripPlanner from Powell and Market to every other intersection in San Francisco, after <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/6536396399/">Eric Fischer&rsquo;s map of walking routes</a> to every intersection in San Francisco. It brings out the transit routes but also shows well-used walking routes. The lines do not vary in width (don&rsquo;t let Market Street fool you, it&rsquo;s actually several lines&emdash;BART, MUNI rail in 2 directions, Muni bus, walking&emdash;very near each other). The lines fade where there are fewer routes using them, because they are rendered as black set at 10% opacity. Where there are more lines overlapping, the lines become darker, in what I believe is a log (or log-like) scale. It ended up just mostly being a map of San Francisco, with transit routes emphasized. It doesn&rsquo;t show potential utilization of the transit system, because the routes are not weighted (it would probably be wise to weight the routes by the density of the block they terminate in and by their service area; i.e., estimate the number of people within the Thiessen polygon of each intersection and weight the route by that). Also, I had difficulty finding an opacity level where the usage of transit routes fades towards the end (as it clearly should) but still shows the streets that walked down by just one or two trip plans.</p>

<p>I think the data I used to make this map could possibly be better utilized to make a cartogram of San Francisco transit times (<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/walkingsf/6350997842/in/photostream">like another of Eric Fischer&rsquo;s maps</a>, but including transfers and walking times).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;d also like to make a companion map using the OTP bike router. I think it could look really interesting in San Francisco, because the router will try to avoid hills.</p>

<p><strong>Methodology</strong></p>

<p>I set up an instance of <a href="http://opentripplanner.org">OpenTripPlanner</a> using a graph built from <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> data for the San Francisco area, as well as GTFS data from <a href="http://bart.gov">BART</a> and <a href="http://sfmta.com">San Francisco Muni</a>. I used the pre-built binaries of OTP. I then used a Python script to request directions from Market and Powell to every other intersection in San Francisco, as defined in the StIntersections dataset from <a href="http://gispub02.sfgov.org/website/sfshare/index2.asp">here</a>. I stored the directions in a PostGIS database. I used one machine as the OTP server, and ran the script and PostGIS on another machine, but I see no reason why they couldn&rsquo;t be on the same machine. I used QGIS to render the map. For what it&rsquo;s worth, I&rsquo;ve <a href="https://gist.github.com/1542816">open-sourced the script I wrote</a>. It may provide a good example of how to use the OTP JSON API in Python.</p>

  <h2>GitHub Image Diffs</h2>
</a>
<p class="author">by mattwigway on December 23, 2011</p>

<p>As you may have gathered, I like <a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> and <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>. Today, I ran across a GitHub feature that is really cool and above and beyond the call of duty: not only do they produce and display diffs on text files, but also on image files! You can see <a href="https://github.com/transit-appliance/Transit-Board-Hotel/commit/4209e30fde29c1557ef59be7df7d6686247e35df?diff-0=1-21">an example in one of my repositories</a>. Added points if you can figure out where the map tile is from!</p>

  <h2>Shapefiles in OpenLayers</h2>
</a>
<p class="author">by mattwigway on December 13, 2011</p>

<p>Update 2011-12-14: It seems that a lot of people are coming here from web searches with phrases like &ldquo;shapefile openlayers.&rdquo; If all you want to do is display your data in OpenLayers, I&rsquo;d highly recommend using a program like <a href="http://qgis.org">Quantum GIS</a> to convert your Shapefile to a more web-friendly format like KML or GeoJSON. Both of these formats can be read by OpenLayers directly, and you&rsquo;ll see faster performance and more browser compatibility than if you were to load your Shapefiles directly.</p>

<p><a href="/a/2011-12-13-shapefiles-in-openlayers/screenshot-at-2011-12-13-214616.png"><img src="/a/2011-12-13-shapefiles-in-openlayers/screenshot-at-2011-12-13-214616.png" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Over the last few days, I&rsquo;ve been using Tom Carden&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/RandomEtc/shapefile-js">shapefile-js</a> library that reads ESRI Shapefiles in JavaScript, which I found via <a href="http://www.prodevelop.es/es/blog/11/12/11/rendering-local-shapefiles-html5">a post on the Prodevelop blog</a>. The library is quite incredible, but his samples use a simple canvas for display. I thought it would be really cool if this could be integrated with <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers</a>, so I created a bit of JavaScript to do so. You can give it a test drive <a href="http://mattwigway.github.com/shapefile-js/ol_simple.html">here</a>, and look at the code <a href="https://github.com/mattwigway/shapefile-js/tree/openlayers">on GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Basically, the library does all the heavy lifting. <a href="https://github.com/mattwigway/shapefile-js/blob/openlayers/src/ol_shapefile.js#L16">My code</a> converts the shapefile shapes to WKT, which is passed to OpenLayers. Ultimately, I&rsquo;d like to see an OpenLayers plugin so that you can use Shapefiles directly (i.e., an OpenLayers.Format.Shapefile). The main issue I see is that there needs to be a new strategy as well as a new format, because a) Shapefiles are made up of multiple pieces and b) we need to use the BinaryAjax loader since Shapefiles are binary.</p>

<p>My code seems to work well with points, lines and polygons, including the donut polygon case (to see for yourself, look at South Africa). (I did not test the donut polygon case, but I think it should work). More eyes are of course welcome! Also, the shapefile-js library can only handle pretty small Shapefiles. If I integrate this into OpenLayers, I think, long term, using a Web Worker thread to parse the Shapefile would be wise (which is another challenge to direct OpenLayers integration).</p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2011-12-13 22:36 -0800:</strong> I tested the donut polygon case.</p>
