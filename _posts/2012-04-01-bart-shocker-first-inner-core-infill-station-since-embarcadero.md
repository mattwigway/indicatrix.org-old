BART shocked Bay Area transit enthusiasts this morning with an announcement that it plans to build a new infill station, to serve all San Francisco lines, at Treasure Island.

"Treasure Island has long been underserved by transit," said a BART employee, who is heading the project and acting as a liaison between the agencies involved. "The residents have long been frustrated that they live within a mile of rail rapid transit but cannot access it."

The announcement has met with mixed results. While most residents of Treasure Island are ecstatic, East Bay commuters are not so pleased. One person, who lives in Castro Valley but commutes via BART daily to his job as a web designer in San Francisco's Mission, complained that it will slow service. "BART travels at up to 80 mph in the Transbay Tube, crossing the Bay in just a few minutes. By adding a stop in the middle of that, you not only add the 20-30 seconds of time at the stop, but also the time it takes to accelerate and decelerate to that stop."

Cyclists, however, are happy about the project. The new eastern span of the Bay Bridge will sport a bike path, but the western span, not scheduled for replacement, does not. By allowing a quick connection between the Yerba Buena Island and San Francisco, a cyclist can ride to Yerba Buena, then catch BART for a quick ride into the city. Responding to the head of the Greater Golden Gate, Gough and Geary Boulevard Cyclists' Association, a BART employee confirmed that the cycle link is a critical part of the project, and that the station will have new electronic bike lockers, as well as easy bicycle access from the bridge.
