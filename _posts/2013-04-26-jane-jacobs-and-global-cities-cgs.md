---

I gave a presentation on the connections between [Jane Jacobs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Jacobs) and [Global Cities Theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_city) at the [California Geographical Society](http://calgeog.org) 2013 conference. The slides from the presentation are on the [Publications](/publications#Conway201204) page.
