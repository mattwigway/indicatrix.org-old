Google Fusion Tables is a fairly new service many may not have heard of: it lets you manage large tabular datasets in the cloud, using Google's infrastructure. You can then visualize that data in a variety of ways, including a Google Map. The coolest feature in my mind is the ability to geocode addresses to a map on the fly. There are lots of datasets out there that, rather than providing a mappable latitude and longitude, provide an address column (or street, city, state, &c., which is easily turned into an address column using the concatenate function of your favorite spreadsheet)&emdash;many of the datasets on [DataSF](http://datasf.org) are like this, as are many others.
