title: Moving to Medium

Here we are early in 2016, and I decided it was time to revisit how I publish my writing. I've had a blog for a while, but I've recently been realizing that
the future is social, and my ideas would be easier to share if they were hosted on a social platform. With that in mind, I'm going to put new posts exclusively on [my Medium profile](https://medium.com/@mattwigway):

<script async src="https://static.medium.com/embed.js"></script><a class="m-profile" href="https://medium.com/@mattwigway">Matthew Wigginton Conway</a>

For those that prefer an old fashioned web address, you can still visit [blog.indicatrix.org](http://blog.indicatrix.org), which will redirect you to Medium.

As always, I'll continue to [tweet](https://twitter.com/mattwigway) all my new posts. This site will continue to be a place to hosts [projects](https://projects.indicatrix.org), etc.
