If any of this blog's readers will be attending OSCON July 25-29th in Portland, I suggest you check out the session being led by my codeveloper, [Chris Smith](http://chrissmith.us/), leader and founder of the [Transit Appliance](http://transitappliance.org/) project, citizen activist and [blogger extraordinaire](http://portlandtransport.com/). He'll be talking about the open-source roots of the Transit Appliance project, and how the use of open data, hardware and software allows us to create arrival displays that are "disruptively low cost." More information is available on the [official page for the talk](http://www.oscon.com/oscon2011/public/schedule/detail/18771).
