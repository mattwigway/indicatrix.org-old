It's official. QGIS 1.7 was released early this morning.

For the details, see the [full press release](http://qgis.org/component/content/article/127-qgis-1-7-release.html). Note also the new qgis.org banner, which appeared as I was writing this post.

1\.7 is a major new release with a multitude of new features; see the above page for a list.

Many thanks to the QGIS team for all of their hard work.
