As you may have gathered, I like [Git](http://git-scm.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com). Today, I ran across a GitHub feature that is really cool and above and beyond the call of duty: not only do they produce and display diffs on text files, but also on image files! You can see [an example in one of my repositories](https://github.com/transit-appliance/Transit-Board-Hotel/commit/4209e30fde29c1557ef59be7df7d6686247e35df?diff-0=1-21). Added points if you can figure out where the map tile is from!
