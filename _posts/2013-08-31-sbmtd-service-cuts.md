title: Santa Barbara MTD Service Cuts
---

Santa Barbara, California's, [Metropolitan Transit District](http://sbmtd.gov) is potentially facing major budget cuts resulting in drastic service cuts come January. The general issue is that California's 2012 Public Employees Pension Reform Act is construed by some to be in conflict with the 1964 federal Urban Mass Transportation Act, and federal funds may be withheld from MTD and other California transit agencies in the brouhahah. Streetsblog has [the story.](http://la.streetsblog.org/2013/08/15/in-battle-over-pensions-federal-government-lets-unions-hold-transit-hostage/)

MTD provides bus service around Santa Barbara, including service to the nearby towns of Montecito and Carpinteria to the east and Goleta to the west. Near Goleta is the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB), a large public university also served by MTD. The service area is largely linear, running from UCSB and Goleta east to Carpinteria. To avoid geographical confusion, it should be noted that the Pacific Ocean is almost due south of Santa Barbara, and the coastline runs east and west (a result of Santa Barbara being situated on transverse block and having rotated over the past 40 million years, but I digress).

MTD has offered several scenarios for the needed 30% reduction in bus service. Initially they proposed a preferred scenario with Saturday schedules becoming active on weekdays and weekend service being dropped on many lines, and an alternate scenario in which many lines were switched to peak-hour-only service. They are now advancing only [one proposal](http://sbmtd.gov/download/news-and-alerts/20130823-DrasticCutsIII/RevisedOptionA.pdf), which is a revised form of the first proposal.

I took this proposal and created a modified version of MTD's schedules (using their [GTFS feed](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/)) to get an idea of the effects of the changes on mobility. I fed the schedule data into [OpenTripPlanner](http://www.opentripplanner.org) and then used [QGIS](http://qgis.org) to visualize the changes. The results are [here](/a/2013-08-31-sbmtd-service-cuts/mtd-service-changes.pdf), for trips from the [Transit Center](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=34.42097&mlon=-119.70350#map=17/34.42097/-119.70351) and the [UCSB bus loop](http://www.openstreetmap.org/?mlat=34.41513&mlon=-119.84786#map=17/34.41513/-119.84786) at different times of day. The first two pages show the existing travel times, while the next two pages show the changes to the travel times if the cuts take place.

There are a few caveats. Many of the lines are going to operate Saturday-style service on weekdays, so I simply substituted the Saturday schedules for the weekday schedules. However, MTD operates a [pulse system](http://www.humantransit.org/2010/12/basics-finding-your-pulse.html), wherein multiple buses arrive at strategic transfer points at the same time, so there is minimal waiting for the transfer. If you sit at the transit center for a while, you'll notice that on the hour and the half-hour many buses arrive (and 15 and 45 minutes after the hour a smaller number do, on the highest-frequency lines). MTD planners will tweak the schedules so that the pulse continues to function. Also, several of the lines have cuts to frequency. Making cuts to frequency requires rewriting the entire schedule rather than just dropping trips, something I'm not qualified to do. On the 24x, in the first proposal five midday trips would have been eliminated, but it wasn't clear which trips these were, so I didn't eliminate them.
